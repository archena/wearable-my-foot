                        **********************


PROJECT AIMS:

Achieve a state of the art running power metric that rivals <a href="https://stryd.com">Stryd</a>, but with a difference.

  ~ Open Source.
  ~ Uses off the shelf hardware (Arduino).
  ~ Inexpensive to build.
  ~ Full transparency of how data is collected and calculated.
  ~ Encourage collaboration for the project from the community.
    + Submit bug reports.
    + Make a feature request.
    + Even better, open a pull request!
  ~ Have fun!


                        **********************

WHY:

  Power based training is very useful for measuring a consistent effort and improving your fitness.

  Power meters for cycling have been around for a while and it is relatively easy to conceive what they do - by measuring the force applied to a bicyle crank (using a strain gauge) and the speed that it moves then we can derive power (Power = Force x Velocity). There are many commercial offerings for cycling power meters or you can <a href="https://sensitivus.com/products/diy-power-meter/">build your own if you want</a>.

  Running power is a different kettle of fish though, there's a lot going on so what exactly are we measuring? Things we might need to take into account include:

    ~ Velocity
    ~ Whether we're going up or down a hill
    ~ How firm (or soft) the ground is
    ~ The weight of the runner
    ~ Steps per minute (cadence)
    ~ How high we raise our feet (vertical oscillation)
    ~ Stiffness of muscles and tendons in the leg (Leg Spring Stiffness (LSS)).

  There are a few commercial running power meters, each of which have their own algorithm and approach to measuring running power. Understandably, for a commercial product protecting its intellectual property, the exact algorithm isn't disclosed.

  Commercial Products:
    ~ <a href="https://stryd.com">Stryd</a> - arguably the <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2413011/running-power-meter-comparison-study">current state of the art</a>.
    ~ Garmin - when paired with their <a href="(https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/561205">foot pod</a>.
    ~ Polar - uses <a href="https://www.polar.com/uk-en/smart-coaching/running-power">smart watch only</a>.
    ~ Runscribe - <a href="https://runscribe.com/power/">some details of how they calculate power</a>.


  Werable <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/my_foot">My Foot</a> aims to be the first Open Source Running Power Meter. The hardware design and software is freely available for anybody to use.


                        **********************

  
HOW:

  * Buy the bits - we provide a shopping list of what you need.
  * Put the bits together - following our instructions.
  * Attach it to your shoe - using gratuitous amounts of gorilla tape and cable ties.
  * Download and install our Android Mobile App.
  * Pair the App with the device and start recording.
  * Go for a run and save the data.
  * Export to GPX or CSV.


WHAT:

  For full details of the hardware and code checkout <a href="https://github.com/fuzzylabs/wearable-my-foot/">the repo</a> on github.
